# Application for calculating utility bills per month.

Simple React app for calculating utility bills for the month with graphical statistics. 


## Getting Started
These instructions will provide you with a copy of the project that will be launched on your local computer for development and testing.

## Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software.

- Git.
- NPM.
- IDE.


## Install
Clone the git repository on your computer
```
$ git clone https://github.com/alavir-ua/react-ubc.git
```
You can also download the entire repository as a zip file and unpack in on your computer if you do not have git.

After cloning the application, you need to install its dependencies.
```
$ npm install
```
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
```
$ npm run dev
```
Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
After that, open the browser at http://localhost:3000/ to view the result.

```
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
```
The first command builds the production application into the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.<br />

The second command starts the Node js server, which serves up static application files.
